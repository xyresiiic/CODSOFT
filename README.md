# 🚀 CodSoft Internship Projects – C++

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my **C++ internship at CodSoft**. Each project helped me strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts and apply them in fun and practical ways.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 🧮 1. Simple Calculator
A console-based calculator built in **C++** that performs basic arithmetic operations:  
➕ Addition, ➖ Subtraction, ✖️ Multiplication, ➗ Division  
It uses functions and conditional statements to process user input cleanly.

### 📝 2. To-Do List (Console-based)
A simple terminal-based to-do list app where users can:  
✅ Add tasks  
🗒️ View tasks  
🗑️ Delete tasks  
This project allowed me to explore **file handling**, **vectors**, and basic **menu-driven logic** in C++.

### 🎯 3. Number Guessing Game
A fun guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.  
This project uses:  
🎲 `rand()` function  
🔁 Loops and conditionals  
📈 User feedback system to guide guesses

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing clean and modular C++ code
- Implementing logic using functions, loops, and conditionals
- Using **file I/O** and **vectors**
- Building interactive terminal applications
