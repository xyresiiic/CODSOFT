#🌟 CodSoft Internship Projects – C++
Hi there! 👋
This repository contains the C++ projects I worked on during my internship with CodSoft. These small but meaningful projects helped me strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts in C++, and gave me hands-on experience building simple console-based applications.

#🔧 What You'll Find Here
##🧮 Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a simple project but a great way to practice using functions, conditionals, and user input in C++.

##📝 To-Do List
A console-based task manager that lets users add, view, and delete tasks. It also gave me a chance to work with file handling and vectors, which are essential parts of real-world C++ development.

##🎯 Number Guessing Game
A fun little game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. I used loops, conditionals, and C++'s random number functionality to bring it to life.

#💡 What I Learned
Through these projects, I improved my skills in:

Writing clean and structured C++ code

Using loops, functions, conditionals, and arrays/vectors effectively

Handling user input and output in console applications

Working with basic file I/O in C++

Thanks for checking out my work! 😊
Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or reach out if you have any feedback.
